## 1. Executive Summary: Zero-Trust & Data Isolation

Northwest Intelligence Solutions LLC provides AI-driven proposal development services using privately hosted, on-premise infrastructure. Unlike cloud-native AI solutions (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) where data is processed on shared public servers, our architecture ensures that **Client Data never leaves our physically controlled environment.**

## 1. Data Sovereignty & Residency

- **Physical Location:** All data processing, inference, and storage occur physically within Bellevue, Washington, USA.
- **No Offshore Processing:** No data is transmitted to, stored in, or processed by foreign sub-processors.
- **No Third-Party Model Training:** Client data is **strictly isolated**. It is used solely for the generation of the specific project deliverables. Client data is **never** used to train, fine-tune, or improve our foundational models for other customers or public use.
