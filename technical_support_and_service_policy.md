# Technical Support & Service Policy

**Support Philosophy: Engineer-to-Engineer**
We believe in direct, competent support. When you contact us, you are not routed to a Tier 1 call center script; you are connecting directly with the engineering team that built the tool. To maintain this high level of technical accuracy, we operate on a structured, asynchronous support model.

### 1. Support Channels & Hours

All support requests must be initiated via our digital channels to ensure proper logging and tracking.

* **Primary Channel:** `support@northwestintelligence.com`
* **Standard Service Hours:** Monday - Friday, 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM PST
* **Response Time Objective:** We aim to acknowledge and triage all tickets within **2 business days**. Complex resolutions or code-level fixes are generally deployed during our evening maintenance window (6:00 PM - 9:00 PM PST).

### 2. Issue Severity & Prioritization

Please categorize your request to help us triage effectively:

| Severity Level | Definition | Response Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P1: Critical** | **System Down.** The service is inaccessible or core data is lost. | **Expedited ( < 12 Hours)** |
| **P2: High** | **Feature Failure.** A core function is broken, but workarounds exist. | **Within 1 Business Day** |
| **P3: Normal** | **General Inquiry.** How-to questions, minor bugs, or account settings. | **Within 2 Business Days** |
| **P4: Low** | **Feedback.** Feature requests or cosmetic tweaks. | **Review Weekly** |

*Note: Please plan your proposal timelines accordingly. We recommend finalizing AI-assisted drafts at least 2 business days prior to your submission deadline to account for any potential technical latency.*

### 3. Emergency Protocol

For **P1: Critical** issues only (Total System Outage), you may use the **Emergency Pager Email** provided in your onboarding packet.

* *Advisory:* Misuse of the emergency line for non-critical items (e.g., password resets) may result in a support surcharge.

### 4. What We Do Not Support (Scope of Service)

To keep our pricing competitive and our focus on software quality, the following are out of scope:

* **IT Generalist Work:** We cannot troubleshoot your firm's local firewall, Wi-Fi, or Microsoft Word installation issues.
* **Proposal Strategy:** We support the *tool*, not the *content*. We cannot advise on the quality of the proposal text or your win strategy.
* **After-Hours "Live" Debugging:** We do not offer phone-based troubleshooting or screen-sharing sessions outside of pre-scheduled appointments.

### 5. Maintenance Windows

Routine system updates and server patches occur on **Tuesday & Friday nights between 10:00 PM - 2:00 AM PST**. The service may be intermittently unavailable during these times.
